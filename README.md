## FlatHashTable
This repository contains implementation of a flat hash map using open addressing with linear probing, inspired by the paper "[Optimal Bounds for Open Addressing Without Reordering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02305)" by Mart√≠n Farach-Colton, Andrew Krapivin, and William Kuszmaul (2025).

The implementation itself is contained in the FunnelFlatHashTable file.hpp, you can download it and use it in your projects. However, I do not recommend doing this because the implementation is very crude.

## Plans
&#x2610; STL-style inerface

&#x2610; Full iterator support

&#x2610; Error and corner cases handling

&#x2610; A more accurate benchmark

&#x2610; etc
